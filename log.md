### Day 4: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practiced destructuring arrays in isolation

**Thoughts**: Destructuring - ES6 Feature, a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables (to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable).

* Old way of retrieving elements of an array: 
const = [2, 3, 4];


const a = arr[0]; → 2
const b = arr[1]; → 3
const c = arr[2]; → 4

* Array Destructuring
const = [2, 3, 4];


const [x, y, z] = arr; → 2 3 4
