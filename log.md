# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spending some time this week revewing and studying how JavaScript works behind the scenes in order to solidify previously learned concepts. 

Today's study session included: 
    1. JavaScript Engine and Runtime
    2. Execution Context and the Call Stack
    3. Scope and The Scope Chain.


### Day 2: April 16, 2021

Today's study session included: 
    1. Variable Environment: Hoisting and The TDZ


### Day 3: April 17, 2021

Today's study session included: 
    1. The this Keyword


### Day 4: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practiced destructuring arrays in isolation

**Thoughts**: Destructuring - ES6 Feature, a way of unpacking values from an array or an object into separate variables (to break a complex data structure down into a smaller data structure like a variable).

* Old way of retrieving elements of an array:


const = [2, 3, 4];


const a = arr[0]; → 2


const b = arr[1]; → 3


const c = arr[2]; → 4

* Array Destructuring


const = [2, 3, 4];


const [x, y, z] = arr; → 2 3 4 


### Day 5: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practiced destructuring objects in isolation

**Thoughts**:To destructure objects we use the curly braces. Then all we have to do is to provide the variable names that exactly match the property names that we want to retrieve from the object. The order of elements does not matter - so we do not have to manually skip elements like in an array. Helpful when retrieving elements from an object when using APIs


### Day 6: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Practiced implementing The Spread Operator (...) in isolation

**Thoughts**: We can use the spread operator to basically expand an array into all its elements (unpacking all the array elements at once)


const arr = [7, 8, 9];


const badNewArr = [1, 2, arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]];


console.log(badNewArr); → [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]



const newArr = [1, 2, ...arr];
console.log(newArr); → [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]



Same exact results. What the spread operator does is to basically take all the values out of this arr array and then write them individually as if we wrote 7, 8, 9 manually.
